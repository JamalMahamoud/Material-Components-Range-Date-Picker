# Material Components Range Date Picker

I've been working on an Android application recently that requires the user to specify a start and finish date. After conducting research, 
I determined that the materia component range date picker is the best appropriate solution. The documentation, on the other hand,
did not clarify how to deal with the selected date, for example, how to determine the number of days selected.
